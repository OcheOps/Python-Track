    "### Question 1\n",
    "Write a Python program that multiplies all the items in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sample list\n",
    "sample_list = [2, 3, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the result to 1 (since multiplying by 0 would always be 0)\n",
    "result = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loop through each item in the list and multiply to the result\n",
    "for item in sample_list:\n",
    "    result *= item\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the final result\n",
    "print(\"Result =\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: \n",
    "- We start with a sample list `[2, 3, 6]`.\n",
    "- We initialize `result` to 1.\n",
    "- We then loop through each item in the list and multiply `result` by each item.\n",
    "- Finally, we print the result, which is 36.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple, from a given list of non-empty tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sample list of tuples\n",
    "sample_list = [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort the list by the last element in each tuple using the sorted function and a lambda function\n",
    "sorted_list = sorted(sample_list, key=lambda x: x[-1])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the expected result\n",
    "print(\"Expected result:\", sorted_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: \n",
    "- We start with a sample list of tuples `[(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]`.\n",
    "- We use the `sorted` function with a lambda function as the key to sort the list by the last element of each tuple.\n",
    "- We then print the sorted list, which is `[(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "Write a Python program that combines two dictionaries by adding values for common keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sample dictionaries\n",
    "d1 = {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c': 300}\n",
    "d2 = {'a': 300, 'b': 200, 'd': 400}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Combine dictionaries by adding values for common keys\n",
    "combined_dict = d1.copy()  # Start with a copy of the first dictionary\n",
    "for key, value in d2.items():\n",
    "    if key in combined_dict:\n",
    "        combined_dict[key] += value  # Add values for common keys\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        combined_dict[key] = value  # Add new key-value pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the expected result\n",
    "print(\"Expected result:\", combined_dict)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- We start with two dictionaries `d1` and `d2`.\n",
    "- We create a copy of `d1` called `combined_dict`.\n",
    "- We then loop through each key-value pair in `d2`. If the key exists in `combined_dict`, we add the values. If the key does not exist, we add the new key-value pair.\n",
    "- Finally, we print the combined dictionary, which is `{'a': 400, 'b': 400, 'c': 300, 'd': 400}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "With a given integral number `n`, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains `(i, i*i)` so that `i` is an integral number between 1 and `n` (both included).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Given integral number\n",
    "n = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate the dictionary using a dictionary comprehension\n",
    "result_dict = {i: i*i for i in range(1, n + 1)}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the result\n",
    "print(result_dict)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- We start with the given integer `n = 8`.\n",
    "- We use a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary where each key `i` (from 1 to `n`) maps to `i*i`.\n",
    "- Finally, we print the resulting dictionary, which is `{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5\n",
    "Write a program to sort a list of tuples by the float element in each tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sample list of tuples\n",
    "sample_list = [('item1', '12.20'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item3', '24.5')]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort the list by the float element in each tuple using the sorted function and a lambda function\n",
    "sorted_list = sorted(sample_list, key=lambda x: float(x[1]), reverse=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the expected result\n",
    "print(\"Expected result:\", sorted_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- We start with a sample list of tuples `[(item1, 12.20), (item2, 15.10), (item3, 24.5)]`.\n",
    "- We use the `sorted` function with a lambda function as the key to sort the list by the float value of the second element in each tuple.\n",
    "- We then print the sorted list, which is `[('item3', '24.5'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item1', '12.20')]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6\n",
    "Write a Python program to create a set, iterate over it, and add/remove items.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a set\n",
    "my_set = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the created set\n",
    "print(\"Created set:\", my_set)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterate over the set\n",
    "print(\"Iterating over the set:\")\n",
    "for item in my_set:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add members to the set\n",
    "my_set.add(5)\n",
    "print(\"Set after adding 5:\", my_set)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove an item from the set\n",
    "my_set.remove(3)\n",
    "print(\"Set after removing 3:\", my_set)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- We create a set `my_set` with elements `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n",
    "- We print the created set.\n",
    "- We iterate over the set and print each item.\n",
    "- We add the number `5` to the set and print the updated set.\n",
    "- We remove the number `3` from the set and print the updated set."
