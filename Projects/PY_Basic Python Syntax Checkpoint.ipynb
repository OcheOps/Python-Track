    "# Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the game is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Guess the Number\" is a single-player game where the player is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback if the player's guess is too high or too low until they correctly guess the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt for User Input:**\n",
    "   Use the `input` function to get the player's guess and convert it to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate Random Number:**\n",
    "   Import the `random` module and use `random.randint()` to generate a random number between 1 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check the Guess:**\n",
    "   Use `if/else` statements to determine if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provide Feedback:**\n",
    "   Use the `print` function to inform the player if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Continue Prompting:**\n",
    "   Use a `while` loop to keep asking for guesses until the player correctly guesses the number."
